I am comparing object detection faster-rcnn and instance segmentation mask-rcnn models which are mentioned below.

I used Google Colab to train the model. All notebook files are uploaded in this zip file and run step-by-step to visualize the output.

The main Jupyter notebook files are in this folder, and their outputs are in the relevant name folder. 
model_final.pth is not able to download pth file in output folder from google colab.

models with there google colab notebook links:
