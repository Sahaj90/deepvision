# Deep vision

## Getting started
**Object Detection**: Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame. It not only detects the presence of objects but also provides bounding boxes around them.  
**Instance Segmentation**: This technique goes beyond just spotting objects in pictures.It draws exact pixel borders around each separate item.
