Getting started
Object Detection: Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame. It not only detects the presence of objects but also provides bounding boxes around them.
Instance Segmentation: This technique goes beyond just spotting objects in pictures.It draws exact pixel borders around each separate item.
